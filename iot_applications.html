    <h1>IOT APPS</h1>
    <h2>Activity 1</h2>
    <p>
      <b>1. What is an iot Applications?</b>
      <br>Iot applications are known for the exchange of data/information among interconnected hardware and software with the help of internet without requiring any human interruption.<br>
    </p>
    <p>

      <b>2. What are the main Features needed?</b>
      <br>1.Connectivity
      <br>2.Sensing
      <br>3.Integration
      <br>4.Active Engagements
      <br>5.Scale
      <br>6.Dynamic Nature<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3. What are some Examples?</b>
      <br>Self-Driving cars
      <br>Smart Homes
      <br>Manufacturing and supply chain management
      <br>Smart grids / Microgrids
    </p>
    <h2>Activity 2</h2>
    <h3>Smart Building</h3>
    <p>
      <b>What does smart mean?</b>
      <br>Smart grammatically means well organised but in other scenario it refers to intelligence.
      <br>Smart means doing the work with more clear mind to get some ideas to work fastly and sharply to minimize the time and effort required for the same task.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>what are some building scenario?</b>
      <br>A Smart building scenario is that it have to interact with with people, system and the external environment/ surrounding.
      <br>Building have to adapt according to the need of people. Mainly it refers to providing more safety, security and comfort which increase the efficiency of work.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>what are the main features needed?</b>
      <br>better algorithm, sensing, thinking, good idea of problem to solve, actuators, reduces building expense and security measures along with some better time management.Database to store complete information and data.
      <br>data or information connecting devices with each other.

    </p>
    <h2>Activity3</h2>
    <h3>Control Interface</h3>
    <p>
      <b>What are the high level features?</b>
      <br>The control interface is bidirectional and processes information to and from the user  and provides option to interact with different devices.
      <br>Control interface reflects the device that is being controlled and the function of the assistive technology.
      <br>Mostly people use different interfaces to access the same device, but for different action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What are the parts needed?</b>
      <br>Sensors
      <br>Actuators
      <br>Data as an input and output
      <br>Buttons
      <br>Navigation
      <br>Strong network and alternatives
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Who are the users</b>
      <br>Consumers of the interface are from varying age groups, depending on the in-built features it. For example, in the case of smart watches, the majority of users are in the 20-40 age group, with a few users in the 12-20 and 40-60 age groups.
      <br>Moreover, the Consumers mainly includes the employee, staff or the general public.
